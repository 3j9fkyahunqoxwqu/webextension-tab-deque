        <em:description>Build a deque of tabs. When the current tab is closed, it is removed from the deque and the next one from the end is selected. Opening a tab in background adds it at the beginning, opening in the foreground at the end of the deque. In both cases, the new tab is opened next to current tab. Selecting a tab moves it to the end of the deque. This should mimic the "Activate the last active tab" "When closing a tab" setting from Opera 12. Note, this is not the same as "most recently used tab" or "last tab selected" other extensions provide. You can also minimize the currently selected tab by clicking on it which removes them from the tab (selecting adds them again). Known issues: After startup and after opening a new tab using the button, a mouse button or key have to be pressed before being able to minimize a tab using the mouse. You can report bugs on https://github.com/sblask/firefox-tab-deque . Patches are welcome.
